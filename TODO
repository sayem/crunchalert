- layout/design rough funcs and page structs ----> understand view/controller/layout/helper ---- do all front-end basics

- then continue working on form + password + cookies/session + welcome email + forgotten password email
- login form and figure out all password with AES + welcome email + forgot password email
- and emailing if they dont remember, and welcome email
- figure out signedin/signed out with cookies



- work out all design/photoshop/etc and do all layout with Rails/CSS -----> model CrunchBase theme, but red/orangeish

DB 
- user table: email address, password hashed
- crunchalerts table: email address, list of CSV crunchbase profile names, boolean news feed 
- cookie table: guid, email address

HOMEPAGE
- login/logout, account settings
- crunchalerts blurb + design
- recently added crunchalerts (last 24 hours) --- show most popular list ------> new links to crunchbase.com
- show images and sign up call if not logged in and search/add box to add an item ---> redirect to login page if not logged in
- logged in ---> show crunchalert list, jquery UI button to remove, search/add box to add things (jquery/ajax responses and make checks/validates for DB)

- search/add box ---> both on logged in and logged out
- option for adding 24hr news update ----> on logged in only

- red/white/gray, some blue/orange theme

ACCOUNT SETTINGS
- change email address/password, delete account

- user login, email, lost password (one-way hash)
- welcome email with actionmailer
- cron email maybe with actionmailer too
-----> careful parsing with nokogiri on cron.rb
-----> and cron-email.rb needs to have good email formatting --- plain and some colors, include all links relevant detail

- need to also think of routing unknown directories back to URL --- 401 redirects, etc on routes.rb

============================================================================================================================

- hone all rules for getting techcrunch/techmeme and milestone data ---- both content and the links; use css selectors
- crunchbase profiles that dont exit, just use nokogiri: (need to validate text inputs too before searching with nokogiri)
    <div class="msg_notice">
      Sorry, we could not find the record you were looking for.
    </div>

- milestones by date
- techmeme + techcrunch posts by date
- use actionmailer for welcome emails and stuff
- cron ruby file every 24 hours and one for every week too

- ADD ----> do regex validation, then pull URL with AJAX as so:

http://www.crunchbase.com/company/foursquare
http://www.crunchbase.com/company/stack-exchange ---- put hyphen in for spaces in words
http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bit-ly
http://www.crunchbase.com/company/art-sy
http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flavors-me
http://www.crunchbase.com/company/formspring

**** if it's a valid regex and we can't find it, then pop up box for inserting their crunchbase URL --- validate and check that if it's good

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- daily/weekly emails
- milestones + techcrunch/techmeme posts

- search >>>> regex valid, check if it exists; if not ask user to submit the crunchbase URL ---- if error or not found, suggest link maybe; ---- format crunchbase URLs just like toolbar ---- but basically take responses and then check and confirm with the user

- have one composite email for each user ----> include everything and all the companies/people they're following
- heavy mailing list manager for bulk mlm

- sign up --- cookie/login user/email --- forgot password link ---- encrypt user details
- cron ----- check all category preferences and pull them ---- 

- heavy mail formatting ---- check mailing list sending
